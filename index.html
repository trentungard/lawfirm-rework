                                        <p>J.D.</p>
                                        <p class="team-abouts">Matt grew-up in the Newberry section of Williamsport 
                                            and graduated from the Williamsport Area High School in 2004. For 13

                                            to the very first AFL-CIO Young Workers Summit, and was an original member of the 
                                            USW’s Next Generation Committee. To this day he stands in solidarity with all members 
                                            of the working class and is a supporter of their causes.
